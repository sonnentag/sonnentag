### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in Holberton School Tulsa's Full Stack specialization with an estimated completion date in the coming weeks.
- ðŸ”­ Our studies have spanned from C through Python, MySQL, Flask APIs, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Node/JS, etc. through to now working with React and Webpack, with weekly interview prep algorithm assignments along the way.
- âš¡ After starting in tech support I've worked as remote hands in datacenters and have extensive experience as webhosting support across many platforms and technologies. I see my current enrollment in Holberton's Full Stack program as a perfect compliment to my previous backend experience.
- ðŸ’¬ I'm always interested in connecting with others who may share similar interests. Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or considerations.
